# Aviation Calculation API
A collection of functions related to air navigation and aviation. This API is based on Aviation Formulary 1.46 by Ed Williams and is written in C. The original use of this API was to do navigational calculations within Microsoft Excel by importing the functions into Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).
